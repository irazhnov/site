      "content":"<p>Okra is a widely available exotic, medicinal vegetable with a gooey texture that can be purchased year round in local markets. It is high in minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients that provide many health benefits and can be used for treating diabetes, preventing kidney disease, alleviating asthma, lowering cholesterol, boosting the immune system, and promoting a healthy pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>A cup of okra contains about 30 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, 7.6 grams of carbohydrates, 0.1 grams of fat, 21 milligrams of vitamin C, 88 micrograms of folate, and 57 milligrams of magnesium.<\/p>\n<p>In 2011, researchers conducted a study that was published in the journal <i>ISRN Pharmaceutics<\/i> in which researchers fed rats water-soaked sliced okra pod solution through a gastric feeding tube. The researchers found that the fiber in the okra helped reduce the absorption rate of glucose, which reduced blood glucose levels in the treated rats. Okra&#8217;s high fiber content also promotes good digestive health and lowers cholesterol levels by binding to cholesterol in other foods so that it can be excreted from the body.<\/p>\n<p>Okra is also useful for alleviating asthma symptoms as it is rich in vitamin C. High amounts of vitamin C found in okra also supports the immune system as it helps to create more white blood cells, which can help protect against pathogens. A 2005 study published in the <i>Jilin Medical Journal<\/i> also indicates that okra is useful for preventing kidney disease as results showed that patients who ate okra daily had reduced signs of kidney damage more than those who were on a diabetic diet. The high levels of vitamin A, B1, B2, B6, C, and traces of zinc and calcium also promote a healthy pregnancy. The fiber and folic acid also helps prevent folic-deficient birth defects and constipation during pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A cup of okra contains about 30 calories, 3 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, 7.6 grams of carbohydrates, 0.1 grams of fat, 21 milligrams of vitamin C, 88 micrograms of folate, and 57 milligrams of magnesium.<\/li>\n<li>The fiber in okra helps reduce the absorption rate of glucose which reduces blood glucose levels.<\/li>\n<li>Okra is useful for preventing kidney disease; patients who ate okra daily had reduced signs of kidney damage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>journal ISRN Pharmaceutics2015.

      "content":"<p>Diets high in calories contribute to rapid weight gain and obesity, which is the highest risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from Temple University in Philadelphia conducted a study to determine what impact modern, high-calorie diets have on the human body and how fast it can lead to a pre-diabetic condition.<\/p>\n<p>The study included six healthy men who were all either overweight or of normal weight. The participants consumed about 6,000 calories every day for a duration of one week. According to the Institute of Medicine, a healthy diet for the average sedentary male aged 30-50 years should average about 2,200 calories, so the amount of calories these participants consumed a day is 3,800 calories higher than recommended. The diet consisted of about 50% carbohydrates, 35% fats, and 15% protein. For the duration of the trial, the participants were also asked to do no physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>In just one week, all of the men gained an average of about 8 pounds and in as little as two days after starting the diet all of the men developed systemic and adipose insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is usually caused by overeating and the production of excessive amounts of oxygen byproducts are extremely toxic to cells.<br \/>\nThis oxidative stress appeared to trigger changes to a glucose transporter protein known as GLUT4 by affecting the protein&#8217;s ability to take up glucose in response to insulin, leading to insulin resistance and providing a likely causal link between overeating and insulin resistance. The results of this study suggests that an antioxidant treatment designed to target GLUT4 might one day help control insulin resistance linked to obesity.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In just one week, all of the men gained an average of about 8 pounds and in as little as two days after starting the diet all of the men developed systemic and adipose insulin resistance and oxidative stress.<\/li>\n<li>This oxidative stress appeared to trigger changes to a glucose transporter protein known as GLUT4 by affecting the protein&#8217;s ability to take up glucose in response to insulin, leading to insulin resistance and providing a likely causal link between overeating and insulin resistance.<\/li>\n<li>The results of this study suggests that an antioxidant treatment designed to target GLUT4 might one day help control insulin resistance linked to obesity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>Boden G, Homko C, Barrero CA, et al. &#8220;Excessive caloric intake acutely causes oxidative stress, GLUT4 carbonylation, and insulin resistance in healthy men.&#8221; Sci Transl Med. 2015;7(304).<\/i><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The link between obesity and diabetes possibly uncovered&#8230;<\/p>\n","date":"2015-09-30 18:01:07","modified":"2015-09-30 18:01:07",

      "content":"<p>Previous studies have shown that peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been shown to increase bone marrow adipose tissue leading to skeletal fragility, which causes increased bone fractures in diabetic patients. PPAR-gamma agonists such as rosiglitazone take glucose out of blood by packaging the glucose into lipid droplets to be stored in tissues such as belly fat and inside bone. Researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine set out to find whether exercise could limit the bone marrow adipose tissue accrual and increase bone formation in patients receiving treatment with a PPAR-gamma agonist.<\/p>\n<p>Eight-week-old female mice were treated with 20 mg\/kg\/day of rosiglitazone and compared with control mice. Exercise groups ran 12 km per day on running wheels. Femoral marrow adipose tissue volume and tibial bone morphology were evaluated by microcomputer tomography after 6 weeks. The results showed that the mice receiving rosiglitazone therapy had a 40% higher femur marrow adipose tissue volume compared to the control group (P &lt; .0001). Exercise suppressed marrow adipose tissue volume by half in the control mice who exercised compared to the control mice who did not (P &lt; .01) and 19% in the rosiglitazone-exercise group compared to rosiglitazone alone (P &lt; .0001).<\/p>\n<p>The results of the study indicate that despite the rosiglitazone-induction of marrow adipose tissue extending well into the femoral diaphysis, exercise was able to significantly suppress marrow adipose tissue volume and induce bone formation. In conclusion, impact of PPAR-gamma agonists on bone and marrow health can be partially mitigated by exercise.<\/p>\n<p>The study&#8217;s author also noted that mice are natural runners and can run several miles at night, therefore their findings are not yet directly relatable to human activity. Whatever the case, exercise does aid in bone health and patients should still be advised on the risk of declining bone health and to find an exercise that suits them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mice receiving rosiglitazone therapy had a 40% higher femur marrow adipose tissue volume compared to the control group (P &lt; .0001).<\/li>\n<li>Exercise suppressed marrow adipose tissue volume by half in the control mice who exercised compared to the control mice who did not (P &lt; .01) and 19% in the rosiglitazone-exercise group compared to rosiglitazone alone (P &lt; .0001).<\/li>\n<li>The results of the study indicate that despite the rosiglitazone-induction of marrow adipose tissue extending well into the femoral diaphysis, exercise was able to significantly suppress marrow adipose tissue volume and induce bone formation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>Styner M, Pagnotti GM, Galior K, et al.

Therefore, a cohort study was performed among 52,600 patients who were newly prescribed either of these agents between January 1988 and 31 July 2013.<\/p>\n<p>A secondary analysis was performed to observe if there was a correlation between the cumulative duration of use and cumulative dose. Then, a follow-up was performed for an estimated five years. The sample population was broken down by glyburide treatment (n=3,413) or other second-generation sulfonylureas (n=49,187) between 2008 and July 2013 to determine risk for cancer.<\/p>\n<p>There was a non-significant increase in the risk of cancer represented by 9%. This was observed with the use of glyburide inclusive. However, findings from the secondary analyses support that the use of glyburide may be associated with an increased risk of cancer. This finding was observed with the dose-response and duration-response correlation.<\/p>\n<p>A rough incidence of 14 per 1000 person-years was newly diagnosed with any type of cancer during the follow-up study, which correlates to 4,105 patients. Comparing glyburide with use of other second-generation sulfonylureas, a non-significant increased risk of cancer was associated with glyburide (HR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.98-1.22). After fluctuating a lag period to two years, researchers found the results to be similar. The use of glyburide for at least 36 months showed a correlation of 21% increased risk for cancer. A dose-response was also found to have a 27% increased risk of cancer.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Overall, researchers believe that additional studies need to be performed in order to validate findings to assess if the use of glyburide has association for a specific type of cancer. In the study performed, when researchers repeated analysis with four major cancers such as prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal, they found that no single cancer type had a correlation for increased risk. Nonetheless, hazard ratio for breast cancer was elevated, and lung cancer risk was under the null and statistically significant.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analysis with four major cancers (prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal) do not show an increased risk for any single cancer type.<\/li>\n<li>According to this cohort study, greater cumulative duration and doses of glyburide were associated with an increased risk of cancer.<\/li>\n<li>Additional studies need to be conducted to validate and assess these findings, and if the use of glyburide is associated with a specific type of cancer.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>Tuccori, Marco, et al. &#8220;The Use of Glyburide Compared With Other Sulfonylureas and the Risk of Cancer in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.&#8221; Diabetes care (2015): dc151358<\/i><\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Higher cumulative doses and duration of glyburide may be associated with increased risk&#8230;<\/p>\n","date":"2015-09-30 17:52:42","modified":"2015-09-30 17:52:42","categories":[{"id":9,"slug":"diabetes-articles","title":"Articles","description":"<p style=\"font-size:12pt; color:green; font-style: italic;\">The list of articles below are ordered by most recent.

More specifically, the study was aimed to assess the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-reported marijuana use, prediabetes and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Prevalence of marijuana use in the middle-aged population has grown since 2002, but little is known about the impact of marijuana use on metabolic health. Previous studies have shown mixed results with some claiming it reduces the risk of diabetes and others claiming it is associated with an increased calorie consumption.<\/p>\n<p>In the study, the researchers investigated the association between self-reported marijuana use, prediabetes incidence and diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Considerations were made for quantity used, status of current use, BMI and waist circumference, age, gender and race.<\/p>\n<p>Data was pooled from the community-based CARDIA study and individuals were ages 18-30 at the time of study recruitment in 1985-1986. In fact, these patients are in their 30th year of observation, but this study looked at 3,034 participants and their marijuana use and whether they had developed prediabetes or type 2 diabetes by year 25.<\/p>\n<p>After adjustments, there was a 65% increased risk of prediabetes in individuals still reporting current use of marijuana and a 49% increased risk for those who reported use of 100 times or more. No significant association could be found between marijuana use and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by year 25.<\/p>\n<p>The authors were baffled by how marijuana could place patients at a significant risk of prediabetes, but not find this risk for diabetes. Many patients were excluded for having missing information and perhaps that made an impact. Further studies may objectively measure quantity used and prospective metabolic health.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the use of marijuana growing in the middle-aged population, researchers sought to explore the associations of marijuana use with prediabetes and diabetes.

In addition, no significant difference was observed for non-fatal MI or stroke. The treatment group also experienced a 32% reduction in all-cause mortality and 35% decline in hospitalization risk for HF.<\/p>\n<p>One of the researchers claimed that this finding was very surprising, as it was not predicted and the results were predicted to be risk neutral. Researchers of the study analyzed data from 7,020 adults with T2DM, a BMI of 45 kg\/m2 or less, HbA1c of 7-10%, and a known history of CVD. Demographics of the study were average age of 63 years, 72% men, average HbA1c of 8%, average BMI 30.6 kg\/m2.<\/p>\n<p>Subjects of the study were randomly allocated in treatment group with empagliflozin either 10 mg or 25 mg (n = 2342), or placebo (n = 2333). Parameters measured were incidence of CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke. Researchers followed participants for roughly three years. In the treatment phase with empagliflozin 10 mg, patients exhibited a reduced risk for CV death (HR = 0.65; CI 95%, 0.5-0.85). For patients in the treatment group of 25 mg empagliflozin, a reduced CV death was also observed (HR = 0.59; CI 95%; 0.45-0.77). This combined HR was 0.62 with 95% CI, 0.49-0.77. The other endpoints of non-fatal MI included HR of 0.87, 95% CI, 0.7-1.09, whereas non-fatal stroke included HR of 1.24, 95% CI, 0.92-1.67.<\/p>\n<p>Patient hospitalization for heart failure also declined with the use of empagliflozin (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.5-0.85). An all-cause mortality reduction was also observed with a combined HR of 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.82. It is important to note that genital infection rate increased for the treatment group, but no increase was observed in incidence of hypoglycemic events, DKA, or AKI. In addition, no increases in bone fractures were observed.<\/p>\n<p>Authors conclude that T2DM patients receiving empagliflozin may have significantly lower risk of composite cardiovascular outcome. This also applies to the outcome of death from any cause. However, this benefit was seen only in T2DM patients with high risk of CV events, and when the drug was added to standard care.<\/p>\n<p><b>Practice Pearls:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jardiance (empagliflozin) added to standard care of therapy among type 2 diabetic patients with a history of CV events may reduce all-cause mortality and risk of CV events by 38%<\/li>\n<li>Most of the other SGLT-2 drugs will probably will show a similar result from their studies.<\/li>\n<li>The use of Jardiance correlated with low incidences of DKA, volume depletion, thromboembolic events, and bone fracture.<\/li>\n<li>These results of this study were unexpected; however, provides data to support long-term use of empagliflozin as well as strong evidence for reduction in CV risk.

While it may not be of much significance to a healthy subject, the degree of these changes is of great importance to individuals with diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Health care professionals (HCP) know that the first step for any person to live a full life, even with diabetes, or any other health condition, is to have enough knowledge about the disease. In diabetes, understanding blood glucose behavior will help patients adjust their lifestyle and engage more with their treatment plan. This will help them avoid current and future problems associated with diabetes complications.<\/p>\n<p>However, before addressing blood glucose behavior, it is important that patients understand some key terminology. Variability is often a hard concept for patients to grasp. Below are patient focused definitions that might help.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glycemia means glucose (sugar) in the blood. Glycemic therefore means \u2018in relation to blood sugar in the blood.&#8217;<\/li>\n<li>Variability means changes from one level to another. In reference to blood sugar, it means the way blood sugar levels change from one value to another, especially how high or how low it goes in a given period of time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So glycemic variability (GV) means: the changes (swings) that take place in the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood and over a given period of time.<\/p>\n<p><b>Helping patients understand why they should pay attention to glycemic variability<\/b><br \/>\nThere are many reasons why it is important to teach patients to pay attention to glycemic variability, some obvious and some not so obvious.<\/p>\n<p>The most obvious reason for patients is that it doesn&#8217;t feel good to have their blood glucose always swinging up and down. Nobody wants to be chasing his or her blood sugars all day long trying to keep it in range. Life with diabetes is stressful enough. Another obvious reason is that the more the person&#8217;s blood sugars are swinging up and down, the more likely it is that they have dangerous highs and lows. Some of these, if not caught soon enough, could result in serious medical complications like severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.<\/p>\n<p>There is clinical data showing that people with high blood glucose variation are at a higher risk of having hypoglycemia or even severe hypoglycemia than those with low glycemic variation. [1] Glucose variability has been shown to be independently predictive of severe hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes [2] and also predictive of nonsevere hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetes [3].<\/p>\n<p>Less obvious is the fact that getting the patient&#8217;s A1C under control in intrinsically tied to their glycemic variability. For someone with high variability, reducing A1C is much harder because with more blood sugar swings they may tend to have more of a risk of hypoglycemia.<\/p>\n<p>So if they take more insulin, or take other diabetes management actions to improve A1C, they could increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia by deepening the swings to the low end of the range. That&#8217;s why if one wants to reduce a patient&#8217;s A1C and their variability is high, it is important to pay particular attention in reducing their variability at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s important for patients to know that they can have a normal or moderate A1C value and still have high glycemic variability. By only looking at the patient&#8217;s A1C number the HCP could be missing this, and not realize that the patient is at real risk of some dangerous glucose swings that could be averted if glycemic variability was reduced.<\/p>\n<p>And if that&#8217;s not enough, experimental findings and some pre-clinical studies have suggested that glycemic variability induces oxidative stress, which provides a positive indication that glucose variability may be involved in the development of vascular disease. [4] There is still no definitive study tying glucose variability to long term complications, but it&#8217;s possible that glycemic variability could be causing both short term complications and long term complications as well. [5]\n<p><b>How to measure and track glycemic variability<\/b><br \/>\nThere is a lot of debate about the best way to track glycemic variability. The author has offered thoughts below on a tool that she believes has advantages, but what is most important is that health care providers help patients track it in some way using some type of glycemic variation &#8220;report card.&#8221; Most importantly, use a tool that both the patient and health care providers are comfortable with.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the more common tools available use the simple Standard Deviation or Interquartile Range. However these tools were not designed with the diabetes patient in mind. As a result, these tools may be better at measuring swings to the high end, but not necessarily the low end.<br \/>\nScientists at the University of Virginia designed another tool, however, called the Average Daily Risk Range (ADRR), specifically for diabetes patients. It takes into account how people test, and the relative clinical risk of going low versus going high. In fact, a study published in Diabetes Care showed it is a more balanced predictor of both high and low blood glucose swings than other measures of variability like Standard Deviation and Interquartile Range. It is also very sensitive to deep lows and significant highs, because they present much more clinical risk for the individual with diabetes.[6]\n<p>ADRR has been characterized in large number of diabetes patients, so it is known what numbers are &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;low&#8221;. An ADRR number above 40, for example, is considered &#8220;high,&#8221; and was associated with patients having, on average, more than half of their readings below 70 mg\/dL or above 180 mg\/dL in the subsequent month. [7]\n<p>ADRR is an important tool that could help people understand not only their glycemic variability, but also their risk of short term complications. But again, what&#8217;s most important is that health care professionals and patients use SOME kind of tool for tracking glycemic variability.<\/p>\n<p><b>How to help patients maintain a low glycemic variation<\/b><br \/>\nOnce a way to measure and track glycemic variability has been selected, the next step is to figure out ways to reduce variation and keep it as low as possible. First the HCP will want to teach the patient how to determine if the variability is caused by a swing predominantly towards one end of the glucose range. For example, the glucose swings may be predominantly towards the high end of the range only, and the patient may not be having much hyperglycemia. If the patient is mainly just skewed high, it may be that the HCP will need to work with them to see if a more intense treatment regimen is appropriate. If their variability is only skewed to the low end, the HCP may actually want to consider a less intense treatment regimen.<\/p>\n<p>There are also options available today that help inform the HCP and patients of daily patterns of highs, lows or swings during certain times of the day (i.e. in the morning or evening) that could be increasing glycemic variability, no matter whether the swings are towards one end of the scale or all over the place. If these daily patterns are corrected, their glycemic variability may decrease over time.<\/p>\n<p><b>Conclusion<\/b><br \/>\nIn summary, helping patients understand glycemic variability and the daily patterns of their blood glucose readings are important for their diabetes control. ADRR is one glycemic variability measure that, when used in conjunction with A1C, can help determine where a patient&#8217;s blood sugars are heading. Today, there are easy to use technology and other tools available that can help with understanding and managing glycemic variability.<\/p>\n<p><b>References:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cox DJ, Kovatchev BP, Julian DM, et al.
